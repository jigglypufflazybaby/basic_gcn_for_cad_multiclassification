# CAD Graph Grouping with GNN

This project implements a Graph Neural Network (GNN) for grouping CAD data based on its edge, face, connectivity, and other geometric information into construction groups (e.g. "Extrude 1", "Extrude 2", etc.). The network is designed for multi-label classification so that each CAD face (node) can belong to one or more construction groups.
